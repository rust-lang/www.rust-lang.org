translated-book = {""}
translated-book-button = {""}
learn-rustlings = Alternatively, Rustlings guides you through downloading and setting up the Rust toolchain, and teaches you the basics of reading and writing Rust syntax, on the command line. It's an alternative to Rust by Example that works with your own environment.
learn-rustlings-button = Do the Rustlings course!
learn-rbe = If reading multiple hundreds of pages about a language isn’t your style, then Rust By Example has you covered. While the book talks about code with a lot of words, RBE shows off a bunch of code, and keeps the talking to a minimum. It also includes exercises!

learn-install-cargo-header = Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager
learn-install-cargo = <p>When you install Rustup you’ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>build your project with <code>cargo build</code></li>
                          <li>run your project with <code>cargo run</code></li>
                          <li>test your project with <code>cargo test</code></li>
                          <li>build documentation for your project with <code>cargo doc</code></li>
                          <li>publish a library to <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> with <code>cargo publish</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:</p>
                        <p><code>cargo --version</code></p>
learn-install-cargo-button = Read the cargo book

learn-install-other = Other tools
learn-install-editors = Rust support is available in many editors:

learn-generating = Generating a new project
learn-generating-steps = <p>Let’s write a small application with our new Rust development environment. To start, we’ll use Cargo to make a new project for us. In your terminal of choice run:</p>
    <p><code>cargo new hello-rust</code></p>
    <p>This will generate a new directory called <code>hello-rust</code> with the following files:</p>
    { $tree }
    <p><code>Cargo.toml</code> is the manifest file for Rust. It’s where you keep metadata for your project, as well as dependencies.</p>
    <p><code>src/main.rs</code> is where we’ll write our application code.</p>
    <hr class="white-hr" />
    <p>The <code>cargo new</code> step generated a "Hello, world!" project for us! We can run this program by moving into the new directory that we made and running this in our terminal:</p>
    <p><code>cargo run</code></p>
    <p>You should see this in your terminal:</p>
    { $output }

learn-dependencies = Adding dependencies
learn-dependencies-steps = <p>Let’s add a dependency to our application. You can find all sorts of libraries on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>, the package registry for Rust. In Rust, we often refer to packages as “crates.”</p>
      <p>In this project, we’ll use a crate called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ferris-says"><code>ferris-says</code></a>.
      <p>In our <code>Cargo.toml</code> file we’ll add this information (that we got from the crate page):</p>
      { $cargotoml }
      <p>We can also do this by running <code>cargo add ferris-says</code>.</p>
      <p>Now we can run:</p>
      <p><code>cargo build</code></p>
      <p>...and Cargo will install our dependency for us.</p>
      <p>You’ll see that running this command created a new file for us, <code>Cargo.lock</code>. This file is a log of the exact versions of the dependencies we are using locally.</p>
      <p>To use this dependency, we can open <code>main.rs</code>, remove everything that’s in there (it’s just another example), and add this line to it:</p>
      <pre><code>use ferris_says::say;</code></pre>
      <p>This line means that we can now use the <code>say</code> function that the <code>ferris-says</code> crate exports for us.</p>

learn-app = A small Rust application
learn-app-steps = <p>Now let’s write a small application with our new dependency. In our <code>main.rs</code>, add the following code:</p>
    { $code }
    <p>Once we save that, we can run our application by typing:</p>
    <p><code>cargo run</code></p>
    <p>Assuming everything went well, you should see your application print this to the screen:</p>
    { $output }

learn-read-docs-header = Learn more!
learn-read-docs = You’re a Rustacean now! Welcome! We’re so glad to have you. When you’re ready, hop over to our Learn page, where you can find lots of books that will help you to continue on your Rust adventure.
learn-read-docs-button = learn more!

learn-ferris-who = Who’s this crab, Ferris?
learn-ferris = <p>Ferris is the unofficial mascot of the Rust Community. Many Rust programmers call themselves “Rustaceans,” a play on the word “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean">crustacean</a>.” We refer to Ferris with any pronouns “she,” “he,” “they,” “it,” etc.</p>
               <p>Ferris is a name playing off of the adjective, “ferrous,” meaning of or pertaining to iron. Since Rust often forms on iron, it seemed like a fun origin for our mascot’s name!</p>
               <p>You can find more images of Ferris on <a href="https://rustacean.net/">rustacean.net</a>.
learn-ferris-alt = a gif of ferris scurrying side to side
