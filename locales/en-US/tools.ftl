        command line, or using rich graphical editors, there’s a Rust
        integration available for your editor of choice. Or you can build your
        own using <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>.

install-notes-rustup-heading = Toolchain management with <code>rustup</code>
install-notes-rustup-description = 
        <p>
          Rust is installed and managed by the
          <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/"><code>rustup</code></a>
          tool. Rust has a 6-week
          <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-release-channels.md">
            rapid release process
          </a> and supports a
          <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html">great
          number of platforms</a>, so there are many builds of Rust available at
          any time. <code>rustup</code> manages these builds in a consistent way
          on every platform that Rust supports, enabling installation of Rust
          from the beta and nightly release channels as well as support for
          additional cross-compilation targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've installed <code>rustup</code> in the past, you can update
          your installation by running <code>rustup update</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information see the
          <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/">
          <code>rustup</code> documentation</a>.
        </p>

install-notes-uninstall-heading = Uninstall Rust
install-notes-uninstall-description =
        <p>
          If at any point you would like to uninstall Rust, you can run
          <code>rustup self uninstall</code>.
          We'll miss you though!
        </p>

install-notes-path-heading = Configuring the <code>PATH</code> environment
        variable
install-notes-path-description = 
        <p>
          In the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the
          <span class="platform-specific not-win di">
            <code>~/.cargo/bin</code>
          </span>
          <span class="platform-specific win dn">
            <code>%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin</code>
          </span> directory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain,
          including <code>rustc</code>, <code>cargo</code>, and <code>rustup</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, it is customary for Rust developers to include this
          directory in their
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">
          <code>PATH</code> environment variable</a>. During installation
          <code>rustup</code> will attempt to configure the <code>PATH</code>.
          Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in
          <code>rustup</code>, the modifications to <code>PATH</code> may not
          take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out,
          or it may not succeed at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, after installation, running <code>rustc --version</code> in the
          console fails, this is the most likely reason.
        </p>

install-notes-windows-heading = Windows considerations
install-notes-windows-description =
        <p>
          On Windows, Rust additionally requires the MSVC build tools
          for Visual Studio 2013 or later. See
          <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html">
          MSVC prerequistes</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          For further information about configuring Rust on Windows see the
          <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows.html">
          Windows-specific <code>rustup</code> documentation</a>.
        </p>

install-other-methods-heading = Other installation methods
install-other-methods-description = The installation described above, via
        <code>rustup</code>, is the preferred way to install Rust for most
