production-title = Rust in production
production-blurb = Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production
        today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know
        and love, like <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">Firefox</a>,
        <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/">Dropbox</a>,
        and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/">Cloudflare</a>,
        uses Rust. <strong>From startups to large
        corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.</strong>
