## Development

### Running the app locally

1. Install `cargo watch` by running `cargo install cargo-watch` in your terminal.

2. To build the app and run the server, run `cargo watch -x run` in your terminal.

3. Navigate to http://localhost:7878 in your browser. If you make any updates to
   the styles, or any other project files, `cargo watch` will automatically
   restart the server for you, all you have to do is refresh your browser to see
   your changes.

### Where to edit

- If you would like to edit styles, you should edit [`src/styles/app.scss`](src/styles/app.scss). 
- If you would like to update group data, you should edit the `yml` files in [`src/data/`](src/data/).
- If you would like to edit page content, you should edit the `hbs` files in [`templates`](templates).
