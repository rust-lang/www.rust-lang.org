# Contributing

A large open source website is a difficult thing to manage. This document will
explain much of the process that we will use while the site is still private.
As it develops, we'll also look to see how we can transition from private to
public. Please file an issue with suggestions!

**tl;dr: Always file an issue first.**

## Design and Content

Design and content are complicated thing, and many folks have lots of polarizing
feels about it. For the moment, large design changes are made exclusively by the
team (listed above). If you have concerns or thoughts for small changes, please
file an issue so that we can discuss it first!

### Content

The content is largely owned by the associated team or working group. If you
have thoughts, it can be useful to discuss those with the lead(s) of those
groups. You can learn more about the teams and working groups on the Governance
page of the site.

If you would like your company to be displayed on the 'Production' page
(i.e. would like to edit `src/data/users.yml`), you should
e-mail core@rust-lang.org (please do *not* raise a PR) with:

 - Your company name, URL and logo.
 - A one short sentence describing your usage of Rust, ideally with a link
   providing evidence (other prospective users will be interested to
   know details). The UI for this can't accommodate more than about two
   lines of text
 - A name and e-mail of a contact within your organization who the
   Rust team can contact should we need to make changes to the web
   page. This information will be kept private.

Logos will be displayed against a white background and constrained
via CSS to a width of 200px by 100px. To support high-resolution
displays, consider submitting your image at a resolution of at least
400px by 200px.

## Development

Before filing a PR to the site, please file an issue. This way we can ensure
that the work you are doing meets the requirements of the site and will be very
likely merged.  If you file a PR before an issue, you will likely be asked to
file an issue, or your PR may be closed outright.
