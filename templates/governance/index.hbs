        <p>Each major decision in Rust starts as a Request for Comments (RFC).
          Everyone is invited to discuss the proposal, to work toward a shared understanding of the tradeoffs.
          Though sometimes arduous, this community deliberation is Rust’s secret sauce for quality.

        <p>The RFC process is also used to establish a yearly roadmap laying out our aspirations for that year.
          This shared vision is essential for keeping the development process focused.

    <p>The Rust project belongs to its community of stakeholders, not to any one company or organization.
      It’s built by a worldwide group of volunteers, students, and paid contributors.
      Organizations that benefit from Rust give back by allocating employee time to Rust contribution
      or by sponsoring community efforts.
      There are people working part- and full-time on Rust at a half dozen companies, big and small.

      <h2>Community standards</h2>
      <div class="highlight"></div>
    </header>
    <p>Rust <i>is</i> its community, and so it’s vital that its culture reflect the project’s values:
      inclusivity, empowerment, kindness, and careful deliberation. We have a Code of Conduct and a Moderation Team to
      enforce it, but in official venues we strive to go beyond that and treat each other with the highest standards of
      empathy and respect.</p>
